# Magical Styles
## Spellcasting
Gaining the affinity for any source of magic provides a cantrip that can be cast at any time and a collection of "Words of Power" you can use to augment your powers. When you gain access to magical powers, you may roll 2 x WOUNDS each morning for formulae you channel each day.

Typically, effects will do one or a combination of the following:
- deal damage equal to 4d10 x d10 HP spent on casting the effect
- target creatures equal to the d10 HP spent casting the effect
- last for a duration of 10 minutes x d10 HP spent casting the effect

Once a spell is cast, make the appropriate save to determine if you have become Spellburned and lose your access to Words of Power for the day.

Choosing your magical effects can be done by combining a Word of Power in the following formulas:

|1d4 | Formulas (2d6 per effect) | 
|----|----------|
| 1  | Physical Effect + Word of Power |
| 2  | Ethereal Effect + Word of Power |
| 3  | Word of Power + Physical Form   |
| 4  | Word of Power + Ethereal Form   |
