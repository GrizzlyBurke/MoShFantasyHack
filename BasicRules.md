# Mothership 1e Fantasy Hack

## Modified Character Sheet

New 1e character sheet with the class and skill tree tweaks [is available here](MoShFantasyCharacterSheet_v1.1.pdf)

## Experience 

### Gaining Experience

You gain 1 Experience(EXP) for every 1000 gp you collect from your adventures, travels, or experiences. Spending your experience requires a week or more of downtime.

- 1 EXP increase a stat by 5
- 2 EXP gain a skill on an unlocked path or start a new path
- 3 EXP to add +1 to your total Wounds

### Taking Downtime

During any downtime, you make choose to carouse the town you are safely resting in. This relieves Stress and allows you to convert Stress into improved Saves for your character. Maximum Stress converted is calculated using the settlement table below:
| Settlement Type | Monetary Cost (gp) | Maximum Stress Converted |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Camp            | Free               | 0                        |
| Village         | 1d10 x 50 gp       | 1d5                      |
| Town            | 1d10 x 100 gp      | 1d10                     |
| City            | 1d10 x 200 gp      | 2d10                     |

Make a Sanity Save:
- On Success: Convert some stress into better saves. Roll the dice associated with the settlement type and add the total to your chosen saves. Relieve all stress.
- On Critical Success: Convert the maximum stress into better saves. Add the maximum value of the settlement's die to your saves. Relieve all Stress.
- On Fail: Do not convert any stress into saves, relieve all stress and begin at 1 Stress. 
- On Critical Fail: Convert and relieve no Stress. Make a Panic Check.
 
 If you failed your Downtime check, roll on the following Carousing table to determine what mishap occured:

### Chilled
