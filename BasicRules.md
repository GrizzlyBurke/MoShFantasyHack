# Mothership 1e Fantasy Hack

## Modified Character Sheet

New 1e character sheet with the class and skill tree tweaks [is available here](MoShFantasyCharacterSheet_v1.1.pdf). In an attempt to make the Mothership Fantasy hack more heroic, players start with higher stats and saves.
Changes to starting stats are as follows:
- Stats are rolled as 2d10 + 30
- Saves are rolled as 2d10 + 20

## Experience 

### Gaining Experience

You gain XP as you collect gold from your adventures, travels, or experiences. Spending experience requires downtime and assumes the player partakes in some sort of training befitting their upgrade.

- 1 XP to increase a stat or save by 5
- 1, 2, or 3 XP to gain a skill or Trained, Expert, or Master respectively.

Every 5 XP, add +1 to your total Wounds.

Follow the table below to determine your gold requirements to level up. Once you've reached the total gold requirement, you gain 1 XP.
| Level |  Gold  | Level | Gold |
|-------|-------|---|---|
| 1     |   0   | 6 | 16,000 |
| 2 | 1,000| 7 | 32,000 |
| 3 | 2,000 | 8 | 64,000 |
|4 | 4,000 | 9 | 128,000|
| 5 | 8,000 | 10 | 256,000|

### Taking Downtime

During any downtime, you make choose to carouse the town you are safely resting in. This allows you to spend gold for XP in lieu of purchasing 
| Settlement Type | Monetary Cost (gp) |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| Village         | 1d10 x 50 gp       |
| Town            | 1d10 x 100 gp      |
| City            | 1d10 x 200 gp      |

 When carousing, each participant rolls against their Body Save to determine how the night has treated them. On a failure, consult the Mishap table below.

| d20 | Carousing Mishaps | d20 | Carousing Mishaps |

### Poisoned

A creature that is poisoned suffers [-] on all Combat Checks it makes when attempting to attack another target, and takes 1 damage per round per poison applied to them. Poisons can be stacked.

### Paralyzed

Incurs 1 Stress on application. Creature must succeed on a Body Save each round. On a failure they suffer [-] on all checks and cannot move more than 1/10th their usual travel speed. Disadvantage on the Body Save for the **second** round of Paralysis. (It takes a bit to kick in)

### Chilled

Entity is slowed down and has [-] on all Speed checks. The target also may only travel at up to 1/4 of its usual travel speed. If an already chilled target is chilled again it must succeed on a Body Save or become Frozen.

### Frozen

The entity is heavily frozen and must succeed on a Body Save (one per round) to break free. The Entity cannot take actions, cannot move, and cannot communicate. Once the entity breaks free it becomes Chilled for 1d5 rounds.

### Marked

Typically via a form of Dye, others have [+] on attempts to track the Marked entity.

### Charmed

Entity is magically under the impression that the applier is a close friend. Entity must make a Sanity Save when the effect is applied. This effect is permanent until some scenario causes the entity to distrust the applier.
