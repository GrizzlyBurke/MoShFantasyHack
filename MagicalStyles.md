# Magical Styles
## Spellcasting
Gaining the affinity for any source of magic provides a cantrip that can be cast at any time and a collection of "Words of Power" you can use to augment your powers. When you gain access to magical powers, you gain a number of Spell Points (SP) equal to ``LEVEL + WOUNDS`` and you may use these to case your spells.. To cast a spell, choose your formula, propose its effect, and select a number of Spell Points (SP) to sacrifice to channel the power.

Spells typically cause a single effect, warping reality or dealing 4d10 damage to a single target. Status effect style spells affect a single target for 10 minutes.

Your spell may deal damage or affect a creature in a particular way, but additional damage, targets, or duration can be determined by allocating the addition SP as described below:

- deal damage equal to 2d10 x SP spent on casting the effect
- target one additional creature per SP used past the first
- last for a duration of 10 minutes x SP spent casting the effect

Once a spell is cast, make the appropriate save to determine if you have become Spellburned and lose your access to that particular Word of Power for the day.

Sometimes a character may wish to cast a spell of great power or a spell after they have exhausted their safe magic energy for the day. In this case, you may do the following:
- Spend 1d10 HP per SP you wish to summon (number of d10s must be chosen before rolling).
- Cast your spell as normal with your bonus SP assigned as you wish.
- Roll your appropriate save for your magic. If you fail, you lose spellcasting until your fully rest.

Choosing your magical effects can be done by combining a Word of Power in the following formulas:

|1d4 | Formulas (2d6 per effect) | 
|----|----------|
| 1  | Physical Effect + Word of Power |
| 2  | Ethereal Effect + Word of Power |
| 3  | Word of Power + Physical Form   |
