## Decoctions

Decoctions are advanced alchemical reagents, usually stored in a glass bauble, jar, or ampoule. Typically a liquid or powder, they can be used as powerful tools to aid in the field. Usually the decoctions are drank to imbibe the effects, though those that apply powerful negative effects can also be thrown at a range of "Nearby" and smashed with a combat check. A successful hit will cause the decoction to apply its affect to whatever target was hit wit hit. You may also add them to drinks or food to relative success... depending on the decoction effect, of course.

## Runes

Runes may be applied to any melee weapon, armor, or shield, providing the individual applying the Rune:

- is at Close range and can touch the item
- has the components on their person
- is currently conscious, can speak, and can move

Casting a rune on a weapon consumes the components and adds the benefits listed below, until all charges are consumed. The process requires the caster to use at least one free hand and speak out loud in elder tongues. If this process is being performed mid-combat, it takes the individual their entire round to perform the process. If the item already has an active rune on it, the older is replaced with the newer. A rune cannot trigger more than once per combat round.

The runes effect triggers and consumes one charge depending on the type of item it has been imbued into, see below:

* Weapon - On a successful hit that deals any amount of damage or wounds.
* Armor - When another successfully lands a hit on the defender and they take any amount of damage or wounds.
* Shield - When another attempts and fails to land a hit on the defender.

The table below also includes the "Crits" column, which is an additional effect that triggers when the above condition occurs and is also a critical hit or critical miss, depending on circumstances.

## Enchantments

Enchantments work identical to Runes, however their effect is permanent. An Enchanted Weapon cannot have any runes applied to it, however.

The cost to enchant an item is the same price in components as the Rune, multiplied by 20. For example the Poison enchantment would cost 4,000gp (200gp x20) to apply to a melee weapon.

A weapon may only have one enchantment at a time. An older enchantment can be removed to make way for a new one at no additional cost.

Enchantments still have charges, the same as Runes. Enchanted items take thirty minutes to restore one charge, and cannot be recharged mid combat. They can however be restored during any non-strenous activities (leisure time, during conversations, dinnertime, etc).

Only one enchanted item can be charged at a time, in other words, if you have 6 charges worth of enchantments across all your equipment it would take a total of 3 hours of leisure time to completely restore all charges.

Typically recharging an item takes the form of polishing it, honing it, or oiling it.
